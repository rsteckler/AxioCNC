Your goal is to check in all files that we've modified in this conversation.  Note that other agents may have also touched files, as well as the ones you've worked in.  If they touched shared files, you can check them in.  Don't check in files you haven't touched - the other agents will do that.
To check in:
1. Look at the uncommitted files to refresh yourself on the changes
2. Look at the diffs to refresh why we made the changes
3. Create meaningful, concise commit comments
4. commit the files
5. push the changes to the remote
